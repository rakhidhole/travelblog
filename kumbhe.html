It is a great place to hang out. Kumbhe waterfall is located near Mangaon. It's still unknown due to its distance and remote location from metro cities.</P>
            <h3>How to reach?</h3>
            <p>Where is Kumbhe waterfall located ? It lies in the Mangaon Taluka of Raigad. The nearest railway station to Kumbhe waterfall is Mangaon Railway station. Taking bus or a train one can easily reach Mangaon from both Mumbai (140 kms) & pune side (110 kms).<br>

                Mangaon to Kumbhe waterfall ( 23 Kms ) using Public transport:<br> From Mangaon one can get ST bus to Kumbhe at 9 am & 230 pm ( a local gave this info which I have not validated). Also there are sharing rickshaws available which will take Rs 50 one side. A complete taxi can be booked for about Rs 400.
                
                From Pune side one will cross Tamhini Ghat to reach Mangaon & can get down at Nizampur ( a stop before Mangaon ) from where you can get local transport to reach Kumbhe.<br>
                
                Kumbhe waterfall by personal vehicle:<br> This is my preferred mode of transport as the place is too faraway from both Mumbai & Pune and cut journey by local transport would take up lot of time. By personal vehicle just put in Kumbhe waterfall on Google maps (location) & enjoy the ride.</p>
