                Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj captured Rairi fort from Chandra Rao More and renamed it as Raigad. Raigad was part of Jawali Forest in Sahyadri Hills, which is one of the dense forests in Maharashtra. In order to describe its forest density, it is written in Bakhar (historical narratives) that, “In Jawali forest, sunlight was also not ever touched to land”.

            <h3>How to reach?</h3>

                <P>Route 1 (via Tamhini ghat): Chandani Chowk–Paud Road–Davadi–Bhira Top–Adarwadi–Nizampur–Mangaon Road via Mumbai–Goa National Highway–Mahad–Pachad–Raigad
                
                (After descending from the Tamhini ghat, there is a road straight up to Pachad, but the road’s condition is not up to the mark).
                
                Route 2 (via Varandha ghat): Pune-Satara Road (NH 4) via Katraj–Bhor–Varandha Ghat–Shivtharghal–Mumbai-Goa National Highway NH 17–Mahad–Pachad–Raigad
                
                Raigad is 23 kilometers from the national highway, and there are signboards on NH-17 in order to go there. The distance between Pune and Raigad is approximately 150 kilometers, and it takes 3-4 hours to reach that place.
                
                Both the approach roads, that is, Tamhini and Varandha Ghat are not safe to travel at night.</p>
